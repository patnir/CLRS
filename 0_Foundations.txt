Chapter 1 - Overview of algorithms and their place in modern computing systems

Chapter 2 - Solve the problem of sorting through two techniques - 
	Insertion sort - incremental approach
	Merge sort - recursive approach, "Divide and Conquer"
Develop notation to express running times

Chapter 3 - Asymptotic notation = bounding algorithm runtimes from above and/or below
OTher mathematicl notation used in the book

Chapter 4 - More divide and conquer, used in multiplying two square matrices
SOlving recurrences - master method

Chapter 5 - Introduction to probabilits analysis and randomized algorithms
