Give the best upper bound that you can on the solution to the following recurrence: T(1)=1 and T(n)≤T([n−−√])+1 for n>1. (Here [x] denotes the "floor" function, which rounds down to the nearest integer.)

You are given an n by n grid of distinct numbers. A number is a local minimum if it is smaller than all of its neighbors. (A neighbor of a number is one immediately above, below, to the left, or the right. Most numbers have four neighbors; numbers on the side have three; the four corners have two.) Use the divide-and-conquer algorithm design paradigm to compute a local minimum with only O(n) comparisons between pairs of numbers. (Note: since there are n2 numbers in the input, you cannot afford to look at all of them. Hint: Think about what types of recurrences would give you the desired upper bound.)
