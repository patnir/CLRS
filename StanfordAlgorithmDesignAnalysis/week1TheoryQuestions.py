#You are given as input an unsorted array of n distinct numbers, where n is a 
#power of 2. Give an algorithm that identifies the second-largest number 
#in the array, and that uses at most n+log2nâˆ’2 comparisons.

#You are a given a unimodal array of n distinct elements, meaning that its 
#entries are in increasing order up until its maximum element, after which 
#its elements are in decreasing order. Give an algorithm to compute the maximum 
#element that runs in O(log n) time.

#You are given a sorted (from smallest to largest) array A of n distinct 
#integers which can be positive, negative, or zero. You want to decide whether 
#or not there is an index i such that A[i] = i. Design the fastest algorithm 
#that you can for solving this problem.
