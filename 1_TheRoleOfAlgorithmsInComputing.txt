1.1 Algorithms

Algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of valuesm as input and produces some value, or set of valuesm as output. It is a tool forr solving a well-specified computational problem.

An algoithm is said to be correct if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output.

Two characteristics that are common to may interesting algorithmic problems:
	- They have many candidate solutions, the overwhelming majority of which do not solve the problem at hand. Finding one that does, or one that is "best," can present a challenge.
	- They have practical applications.

Data structures - a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.

Usual measure of efficiency is speed - how long an algorithm takes to produce its result.

NP-complete - no known solutions for these problems

Conves hull - Smallest convex polygon containing the points.
